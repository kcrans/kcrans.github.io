Summary: My solutions for 2023's Advent of Code

This year I'm doing Advent of Code in Python. My focus is less on learning the specifics of a given programming language and more on algorithms and problems solving (and above all else having fun!). We're only a few days from the end, but I've posted my solutions up to now in this [repo](https://github.com/kcrans/aoc_2023). Take a look if you'd like, I've made sure the code is clear and have added comments to explain my thinking when relevant.
