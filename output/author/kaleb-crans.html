                    <h2>The idea</h2>
<p>When I graduated from university earlier this year, I wanted to decorate my cap in some CS-y way. So some sort of embedded project made sense. I thought about maybe attaching some LED lights that change color or intensity based off accelerometer readings, but then I saw these HUB75 RGB LED matrix displays on <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4732">Adafruit</a>. They're the same type of display you seen used as billboards, in airport terminals, etc...</p>
<p>In order to control the display, I decided to go with a Teensy 4.1. There are attachments for <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3211">Raspberry Pis</a> and even all-in-one <a href="https://www.makerfabs.com/esp32-trinity.html">ESP32 units</a>. But I went with a Teensy because it's compact and can be used for other projects in the future. Instead of wiring a bare Teensy to the display (which would likely need 5V level shifters and be bulky), I used the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/pixelmatix/smartled-shield-for-teensy-4#products">SmartLED shield</a> which is designed to work with the helpful <a href="https://github.com/pixelmatix/SmartMatrix/">SmartMatrix</a> library. One of the most common uses of the library is to display animated gifs, which I thought would be an easy way to display some cool graphics. </p>
<h2>The build</h2>
<p>In sum, the supplies I used were:
* 64x64 RGB LED Matrix with 3mm Pitch
* Teensy 4.1 (headers were pre-soldered, but you can solder your own)
* SmartLED Shield for Teensy 4
* 20,000 mAh USB power bank
* USB cables (preferably power-only)
* 4x4 Matrix Keypad
* microSD Card</p>
<p>I used Velcro strips to affix the panel and keypad to my graduation cap, and cut holes through the top in order to bring the wiring behind my neck.</p>

                    <p>Hi, welcome to my blog! My plan is to post writeups for projects I work on here, and also just anything else I find interesting that deserves more than a tweet. The internet is full of dead blogs that started off with intentions like mine, so let's see how long this one lasts. If I make a substack, I'll be sure to let you know. </p>
